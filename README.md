# Task Code Implementation

This project contains solutions to a variety of computer science problems, including palindrome detection, word reversal, promotional code calculation, and integer separation and sorting. Each task is explained with a clear description and code implementation.

---

## Task 1: Palindrome Detection

### Problem Statement:
Given a word, determine if the word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards as it does backwards.

### Example:
- **Input**: `cekPalindrom('malam')`
- **Output**: `Palindrom`

## Task 2: Reverse Words
Given a sentence, reverse the order of the words in the sentence.

### Example:
- **Input**: `reverseWords('Saya Belajar Javascript')`
- **Output**: `Javascript Belajar Saya`

## Task 3: FazzFood Discount Calculation

### Problem Statement:
Deni is ordering food using the Fazzfood app. There are two promo codes available:

- Promo 'FAZZFOOD': Requires a minimum order of 50,000 and gives a 50% discount, with a maximum discount of 50,000.
- Promo 'DITRAKTIR60': Requires a minimum order of 25,000 and gives a 60% discount, with a maximum discount of 30,000.

Additionally:

- For the first 2 km, a delivery fee of 5,000 is charged. For each additional kilometer, a charge of 3,000 per km is added.
- Some restaurants apply a 5% tax if applicable.

### Function Signature:

function fazzFood(harga, voucher, jarak, pajak)

## Task 4: Integer Separation and Sorting

### Problem Statement:
Given a sequence of integers where 0 (zero) is used as a separator between numbers, split the numbers, sort each of them, and combine them back into one integer.

### Example:
- Input: splitAndSort(5956560159466056)
- Output: 55556666999

### Function Signature:
function splitAndSort(angka)
